# Breaking changes in v8

The library now requires semantic-release 24 and several internal plugin major versions also got bumped:

- `@semantic-release/commit-analyzer` is now using v13
- `@semantic-release/release-notes-generator` is now using v14
- `conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits` is now using v8

In most cases the update should just work unless you are using other plugins that are incompatible with the new versions.

## Upgrade instructions

Reinstall the peer dependencies in the project:

```shell
npx install-peerdeps --dev @open-turo/semantic-release-config
```
