# Breaking changes in v6

Branches configuration is now simplified and only `main` and maintenance branches are supported.

We no longer support pre releases for feature branches.

## Upgrade instructions

If you still need to support pre releases for feature branches, you can add the following configuration
to your semantic-release config file:

```json
{
  "branches": [
    "main",
    "+([0-9])?(.{+([0-9]),x}).x",
    {
      "name": "(f|b|c)/*",
      "channel": "next",
      "prerelease": "beta-${(/^[a-zA-Z]+-[0-9]+/.exec(name.substr(2)) || [name.replace(/[_/.]/g, '-')])[0]}-${Date.now()}"
    }
  ]
}
```
